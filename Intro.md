`obsidian-blog` is a simple static site generator inspired by [Jekyll][jekyll] and written in Python. It allows you to use your atomic notes to compile static pages and posts as [MoCs][moc]. Sounds interesting, isn't it?

Need to mention, `obsidian-blog` is not a one-click-ready-to-go blog. It requires some basic codding skills to tinker a bit with [handlebars][handlebars] and css to cook what you need.
